The course spans one year and is specifically designed for students in the Integrated Science Laboratory class. It involves rotating through eight different laboratories, where students replicate classical projects unique to each lab. My rotations included labs led by Chao Tang, Heping Cheng, Hongkui Deng, Zemin Zhang, Yanyi Huang, Zhi Qi, Chu Wang, and Yuxin Yin. 

The summary above encapsulates a portion of the experiments I engaged in.
The code involved in this section of the work is rather fragmented, with the data processing and analysis tasks being reflected in the experimental report.

The course spans one year and is specifically designed for students in the Integrated Science Laboratory class. It involves rotating through eight different laboratories, where students replicate classical projects unique to each lab. My rotations included labs led by Chao Tang, Heping Cheng, Hongkui Deng, Zemin Zhang, Yanyi Huang, Zhi Qi, Chu Wang, and Yuxin Yin. The summary above encapsulates a portion of the experiments I engaged in.

This experience allows students to gain a diverse set of skills and knowledge, exposing them to various fields and research methodologies. Working on classical projects in these labs not only helps in understanding the foundational experiments that have shaped the scientific landscape but also provides insights into how scientific inquiry and experimentation evolve. Through such a comprehensive program, students are poised to develop a broad perspective on science, fostering both depth and versatility in their approach to research and problem-solving.
